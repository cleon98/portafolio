        <p class="wia-text"> I am an undergraduated professional in International Relations. After my graduation I was determined to 
            enroll in a graduate program and I did it. I was admitted to a master about International Cooperation for the Development, 
            sadly some situations out of my control denied me the opportunity to go ahead with my plan.<br><br>

            After not being able to start my studies I was not sure about what to do next so in the aftermath I decided to start learning
            about programming. I always had a genuine interest but never actually took the time to learn. I got summerged
            in the topics and felt so passionate about it but I had a problem, there were moments when I would not understand something 
            and would stay stuck there. <br><br>

            With this passion just discovered I decided to get into Full-Stack web developer bootcamp and after some really hard 
            and intense months I got to finish it adquiring the skills demanded by the market to be a high value professional.
